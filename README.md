# Resistor Colour Code Calculator

A web-based **Resistor Colour Code Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This tool helps calculate resistance values and tolerance ranges for **4-band and 5-band resistors** based on standard electronics colour coding.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Supports **4-band and 5-band resistors**
- Dynamic colour selection for each band
- Automatic resistance calculation
- Displays:
  - Nominal resistance
  - Tolerance percentage
  - Minimum and maximum resistance range
- Clean and interactive UI
- Built using **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Select the number of bands (4 or 5)
2. Choose colours for each band
3. The calculator:
   - Converts colours to numeric values
   - Applies multiplier
   - Calculates tolerance limits
4. Results are displayed instantly on the page
